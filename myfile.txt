he stock market has already been volatile this year and investors are
wondering what's next.
The S&P 500 had a rough start in April, shedding about 3% halfway
through the month, only to end up 0.6% for the month. The S&P 500
finished April close to a record high, while the Dow closed at a
record high. 
Many investors are wondering if we're in a bubble or if there's a
correction coming.
In his latest quarterly letter, Jeremy Grantham, veteran fund manager
at GMO, put out his "best guesses for the next two years."
Grantham draws on John Hussman's research that shows "an overpricing
for the U.S. markets that ranges from 75% overpriced to 125% at the
end of March." Meanwhile Grantham writes that GMO "very much agrees
with the spirit of this data, but our preferred measure for our 7-Year
Forecast has the market slightly less overvalued at 65%."
